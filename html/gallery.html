        <h3>Travels</h3>
        <p>I’ve always had a passion for traveling. It allows me to explore new cultures, meet interesting 
            people, and discover beautiful places. Traveling broadens my perspective, inspires creativity,
             and gives me a sense of adventure. Whether it's a weekend getaway or a long journey, 
             every trip brings something unique and memorable.</p>

        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>Hiking is one of my favorite activities because it allows me to connect with nature while 
            challenging myself physically. Being out on a trail, surrounded by beautiful landscapes, 
            gives me a sense of peace and accomplishment. It’s a great way to clear my mind, stay fit, 
            and explore the outdoors.</p>

        <h3>Gym</h3>
        <p>I enjoy going to the gym as it helps me stay physically fit and improves my overall well-being. 
            It’s a great way to push my limits, build strength, and relieve stress. Whether it’s 
            lifting weights or doing calisthenics, I find the gym to be a motivating environment that helps me set 
            and achieve personal goals while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>

        <h3>Dancing</h3>
        <p>Dancing is one of my greatest passions, and I love exploring different styles like discofox, hustle, 
            rock 'n roll, and west coast swing. These dances allow me to express myself, stay active, 
            and have fun. Whether it’s the fast-paced energy of rock 'n roll or the smooth, flowing 
            movements of west coast swing, dancing brings joy and connection, and it’s a perfect way 
            to unwind and socialize.</p>

          <h3>Running</h3>
          <p>It's a simple yet powerful activity that allows me to challenge myself, improve my endurance, 
            and experience the outdoors in a different way. </p>
          <p>In November, I’m aiming to complete the marathon in Athens. It’s been a long-term goal of mine,
             and I’m excited to take on this challenge. Training has been tough, but the idea of running 
             in such a historic city keeps me motivated. I can’t wait to cross the finish line and 
             accomplish this personal milestone!</p>
