        <p>A finite field (or Galois field) is a set of elements in which the operations of addition, 
        subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) are defined and behave similarly 
        to the familiar arithmetic operations on integers. However, finite fields contain a limited number 
        of elements, unlike the infinite set of integers or real numbers. The size of the finite field is
         typically a prime number or a power of a prime. Finite fields play a crucial role in areas like 
         cryptography and error correction, where mathematical structures with specific properties are 
         required. </p>
         <p>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to 
            securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. The protocol relies on the 
            difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in a finite field, which makes it 
            computationally infeasible for an attacker to determine the shared secret even if they 
            intercept all the public communication. In the Diffie-Hellman scheme, both parties select a
             large prime number and a primitive root modulo that prime. They each choose a private key, 
             compute their public key, exchange the public keys, and then use the public keys and their 
             private keys to generate a shared secret key. This shared key can then be used for encryption,
              ensuring that even though the public keys are exchanged openly, the actual shared key 
              remains confidential.</p>

        <p>In my project, I implemented the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
             The system works by having two users each generate their own private key, 
             compute a public key based on a chosen generator, and then exchange their public keys. 
             Upon receiving the public key of the other party, each user uses their own private key 
             and the other party’s public key to compute the shared secret. This project showcases the 
             effectiveness of finite fields in creating secure cryptographic systems, while also 
             providing an understanding of the importance of the underlying mathematics that make
             protocols like Diffie-Hellman secure.</p>

            opposite side before your opponents do. Players take turns moving one piece at a time, either 
            by moving to an adjacent space or by jumping over other pieces in a chain. The game encourages
             strategic planning, long jumps, and blocking opponents. </p>
