        <h1>Let Me Introduce Myself</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm a third year Algorithmic Computer Science student at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. </p>
        <p>I have a strong passion for programming, especially in Java.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm balancing my studies with my work at Capgemini as a Software Engineer, where I work with Java and PL/SQL.</p>
        <p>I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing code, and constantly improving my skills in backend development.</p>
        <p>Recently, I've also been focusing on expanding my skills in frontend development, 
            learning new technologies and frameworks to build more dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
        <p>Before my first job in IT, I spent three years working in the gastronomy industry, including time in Germany. 
            I also pursued my passion for sharing knowledge as a private tutor and worked as a tour guide in Berlin. 
            These experiences are still a part of me, and from time to time, 
            I enjoy revisiting them as a refreshing break from coding.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I like exploring new technologies, reading about algorithms, and diving into software architecture. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in the world of software engineering. </p>

        <h1>Abstract Algebra and Graph Theory</h1>
        <p>I have a strong interest in abstract algebra and graph theory, two fundamental areas of mathematics that play a crucial role in computer science and algorithm design.
        <p>Abstract algebra fascinates me due to its focus on structures such as groups, rings, and fields. 
            I enjoy exploring how these abstract concepts provide powerful tools for solving problems in various 
            domains, from cryptography to error correction. Understanding the properties and behaviors 
            of algebraic structures helps me in optimizing algorithms and understanding more complex theoretical 
            problems.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, graph theory is particularly captivating because of its wide range of 
            applications in areas like networking, social media, and computational biology. 
            I find it exciting to analyze the connectivity, paths, and cycles within graphs to solve 
            real-world problems. Concepts such as shortest paths, graph coloring, and network flows are 
            areas I enjoy studying in depth, as they provide essential solutions in areas ranging from 
            routing algorithms to machine learning.</p>

        <br>
        <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p>Recently, I have developed a strong interest in artificial intelligence and have begun taking 
            my first steps in exploring this fascinating field. AI has the potential to revolutionize 
            industries and solve problems that were once thought to be unsolvable, which makes it a 
            highly exciting area to dive into.</p>
        <p>I’ve started experimenting with Python, a language that is widely used in AI development, 
            and am working on creating my first programs that utilize machine learning algorithms 
            and data analysis techniques. My goal is to understand how AI models are trained, 
            how they can be applied to real-world problems, and how to improve them for more efficient 
            and accurate results.</p>
